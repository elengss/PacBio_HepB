This folder contains the reference files for the HBV genotype D clone (GenBank ID NC_003977.2) used in the experiments.

The D3L fasta file is 3581 bp and runs from the first TSS for preCore (preC-L, 1525) to the TATAAA Poly Adenylation Site (PAS, 1918-1923). The coordinates used in the GTF file are adjusted accordingly. 

The sequence of the plasmid backbone (pUC57.fa) used for the HBV1.3 construct is also included.

The Ensemble database annotation file for the human transcriptome (ENST_ENSG_GN), used in the differential expression analysis 
(differential.R) and for identification of chimeric transcripts (quantify_human_chimare.R) is also included.

Human fasta and GTF files should be downloaded from here :

https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_41/GRCh38.p13.genome.fa.gz
https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_41/gencode.v41.primary_assembly.annotation.gtf.gz

The downloaded .gz archive files should be decompressed (unzip utility) before use to give the files GRCh38.p13.genome.fa and gencode.v40.chr_patch_hapl_scaff.annotation.gtf
