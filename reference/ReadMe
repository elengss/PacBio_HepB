This folder contains the reference files for the HBV clone used in the experiments (fasta format sequence and the GTF annotation file).
The sequence of the plasmid backbone (pUC5.fa) used for the HBV1.3 construct is also included.

The Ensemble database annotation file for the human transcriptome (ENST_ENSG_GN), used in the differential expression analysis 
(differential.R) and identification of chimaeric transcript (quantify_human_chimare.R) is also included.
