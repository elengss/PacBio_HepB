The 3 files in this directory should be run in the correct sequence :

extract_soft_clipped.R takes the files previously generated by the align-script.sh and extracts the positive and negative strand clipped reads.

map_soft_clipped.sh takes the output files from extract_soft_clipped.R and maps them to the human genome. 
The script then uses samtools to filter short reads (<100bp) and identify reads mapping to the pUC57 plasmid backbone used in the transfection experiment.

quantify_human_chimera.R takes the files generated by remap_soft_clipped.sh and maps them to the human genome to identify the chimeric sequences found.
