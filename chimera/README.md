The 3 files in this directory should be run in the correct sequence :

<b>extract_soft_clipped.R</b> takes the files previously generated by <b>align-script.sh</b> and extracts the positive and negative strand clipped reads.

<b>map_soft_clipped.sh</b> takes the output files from extract_soft_clipped.R and uses the PBMM2 program to align them to the human genome, D3L virus sequence and the pUC57 plasmid backbone. 
The script then uses the samtools program to filter short reads (<100bp) and identify reads mapping to the pUC57 plasmid backbone used in the transfection experiment.

<b>quantify_human_chimera.R</b> takes the files generated by map_soft_clipped.sh and maps them to the human genome to identify the chimeric sequences found.
